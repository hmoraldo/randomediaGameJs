Randomedia Game (JS port)

What is this
------------

Randomedia was a game I developed sometime between 2001 and 2003. It was originally a game for DirectX; this is the SDL port, and the Javascript port using Emscripten.

- Javascript version: try it [here](http://hmoraldo.github.io/randomedia/randomedia.html) (use WASD keys and space on the web version)
- SDL version: build to test

Known issues
------------

- The web version works better with WASD than with arrow keys, so the arrow keys are disabled for web
- Sound and music and other pieces of code (like some menues) have been removed
- Code is very old, and very ugly (which I hope means my coding taste evolved in the last 10 years)
