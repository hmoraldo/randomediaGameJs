Randomedia Game (JS port)

What is this
------------

Randomedia was a game I developed sometime between 2001 and 2003. It was originally a game for DirectX; this is the SDL port, and the Javascript port using Emscripten.

Known issues
------------

- Startup is slow; you can skip the intro using space, but the menu takes some seconds to get responsive again
- The old intro and menu don't make a lot of sense for the web world
- Sound and music and other pieces of code are disabled
- Code is very old, and very ugly (which I hope means my coding taste evolved in the last 10 years)
- The game is quite slow in Javascript, but playable (compiled natively using SDL, however, it does about 1k fps, which is more than enough)
